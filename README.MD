# Repository for "RBCTest: Leveraging LLMs to Mine and Verify Oracles ofAPI Response Bodies for RESTful API Testing"

This repository contains the resources and code related to the paper "RBCTest: Leveraging LLMs to Mine and Verify Oracles ofAPI Response Bodies for RESTful API Testing."

## Major Revision

1. We followed the suggested procedure to obtain request-response pairs in [`agora/Beet/spec`](agora/Beet/spec).
2. We have repeated 5 times all our experiments involving RBCTest to generate the outputs and computed/reported the mean results

- RBCTest Dataset:  [`approaches/our_data/our_mining`](approaches/our_data/our_mining)
- AGORA+ Dataset:  [`approaches/agora_data/our_mining`](approaches/agora_data/our_mining)

3. We have augmented the current description of the mismatches with the actual mismatch/actual response obtained in the experiments (See in paper)
4. We have computed and updated those TP, FP, and FN values:

- RBCTest Dataset:  [`approaches/our_data/CompareOurData.xlsx`](approaches/our_data/CompareOurData.xlsx)
- AGORA+ Dataset:  [`approaches/agora_data/CompareAGORAData.xlsx`](approaches/agora_data/CompareAGORAData.xlsx)

5. We have added details and reported the categories of oracles:

- RBCTest Dataset: [`approaches/our_data/our_ground_truth`](approaches/our_data/our_ground_truth)
- AGORA+ Dataset: [`approaches/agora_data/our_ground_truth`](approaches/agora_data/our_ground_truth)


## Folder Structure

- [`RBCTest_dataset`](RBCTest_dataset): Our self-collected dataset, contains of 8 services, including an OpenAPI specification for each service.
- [`agora_dataset`](AGORA_dataset): AGORA's dataset.
- [`approaches`](approaches): Includes our ground-truth constraints,agora plus mining, detected constraints from RBCTest, RBCTest- and testsets used to evaluation mismatch.
- [`src`](src): Source code.
- Benchmark for API Constraints Mining in [`approaches/agora_data/our_ground_truth`](approaches/agora_data/our_ground_truth) and [`approaches/our_data/our_ground_truth`](approaches/our_data/our_ground_truth).

## Usage

### Environment Setup

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file under the [`src`](src) directory with the following content:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   ```

   Please ensure that your key supports the required models.

### LLM Config

- Edit LLM model in [`src\utils\gptcall.py`](src\utils\gptcall.py) default to GPT-4o and temperature = 0

### Constraint Mining

1. **Request-Response Constraints:**
   - For our approach:

     ```bash
     python src/request_response_constraint_mining.py
     ```

   - For the ablation approach:

     ```bash
     python src/response_property_constraint_mining_ablation.py
     ```

2. **Response Property Constraints:**
   - For our approach:

     ```bash
     python src/request_response_constraint_mining.py
     ```

   - For the ablation approach:

     ```bash
     python src/request_response_constraint_mining_ablation.py
     ```

### Constraint Test Generation

- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python src/constraints_test_generation.py
  ```

## Evaluation

- To re-evaluate constraints mining, run:

  ```bash
  python src/evaluate_constraints_mining.py
  ```

- To re-evaluate test generation, run:

  ```bash
  python src/evaluate_test_gen.py
  ```

## Experimental Results

### RQ1 Results on AGORA and RBCTest Dataset

#### AGORA Dataset

- All Dynamic (AGORA) detected invariants: [`AGORA-eval/agora_all.xlsx`](AGORA-eval/agora_all.xlsx)
- All Static (LLM-based) detected constraints: see sub-folders in [`approaches/agora_data/our_mining`](approaches/agora_data/our_mining)
- Overlapping analysis: [`AGORA-eval/overlapping_analysis_all.xlsx`](AGORA-eval/overlapping_analysis_all.xlsx)

#### RBCTest Dataset

- All Dynamic (AGORA) detected invariants: see file invariants.csv in each sub-folders [`approaches/our_data/agora_mining/`](approaches/our_data/agora_mining)
- All Static (LLM-based) detected constraints: see sub-folders in [`approaches/our_data/our_mining/`](approaches/our_data/our_mining/)
- Overlapping analysis: [`approaches/agora_data/Overlapping.xlsx`](approaches/agora_data/Overlapping.xlsx) and [`approaches/our_data/Overlapping.xlsx`](approaches/our_data/Overlapping.xlsx)

**Annotation:** in column "Better"

- `1`: Static constraint is better
- `-1`: Dynamic invariant is better
- `0`: Equivalent constraint
